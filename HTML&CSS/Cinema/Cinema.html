                                    against a Romulan mining vessel looking for Ambassador Spock, who in this time, has grown on Vulcan disdained by
                                    his neighbors for his half-human heritage. 25 years later, James T. Kirk has grown into a young rebellious troublemaker.
                                    Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy academy instructors
                                    like Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency on Vulcan and the newly-commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed
                                    with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical
                                    trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new

                                        In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis
                                        in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed
                                        to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle
                                        against his own near-immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before.

                            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                            content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
                            that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                            'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                            text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                            Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                            (injected humour and the like).

                            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                            alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                            believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                            anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet
                            tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                            It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
                            to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                            Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                            undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
                            the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
